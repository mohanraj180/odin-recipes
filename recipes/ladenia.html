        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Ladenia is a type of soft flatbread thatâ€™s topped with tomato slices, onions, and a generous drizzle of Greek olive oil. Hailing from Kimolos, this savory delicacy is considered to be the Greek take on Italian pizza, and it is believed to date back to the time of the Venetian occupation of the island.</p>
        <p>The dough is typically made with flour, yeast, water, and salt, although some versions also call for the addition of olive oil to the combination. Homemade tomato paste is often used in case there are no fresh tomatoes, while some people tend to enhance the simple tomato-onion topping with the addition of capers and peppers.</p>
        <h4>Ingriedients</h4>
        <h4>Dough</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>7 gm yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>3 1/4 plain flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Topping</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 cup tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 red onion</li>
            <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oregano(Greek)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the dough, combine the water and yeast - cover and allow it to activate-about 10 mins. Add the olive oil, salt and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Begin by adding 2 cups of flour and mixing thoroughly and then slowly adding the last cup until you have an elastic, pliable dough. If you find it is still too sticky try adding a few tbsps of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough for about 5-6 mins applying lot of elbow grease. Lay the dough on your pre-oiled baking dish and proceed to stretch it out ensuring it reaches the edges of your baking dish.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough in cling wrap and with a kitchen towel and leave it to rise in a warm place for about 45 mins-1 hour.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has doubled in size, combine your heirloom tomatoes, onions, olive oil, salt and pepper in a bowl and spread this mix evenly over the dough.</li>
            <li>Top with generous amounts of Greek oregano and bake in pre heated 200 deg C oven for about 40-50 mins.</li>
            <li>Cut up into pieces and serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
