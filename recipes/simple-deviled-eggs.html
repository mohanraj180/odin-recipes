        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Deviled eggs are hard-boiled eggs that have been shelled, cut in half, and filled with a paste made from the egg yolks mixed with other ingredients such as mayonnaise and mustard. They are generally served cold as a side dish, appetizer or a main course</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Smoked Spanish paprika, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
                <li>Place eggs in a single layer in a saucepan and cover with enough water that there's 1 1/2 inches of water above the eggs. Heat on high until water begins to boil, then cover, turn the heat to low, and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and leave covered for 14 minutes, then rinse under cold water continuously for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Crack egg shells and carefully peel under cool running water. Gently dry with paper towels. Slice the eggs in half lengthwise, removing yolks to a medium bowl, and placing the whites on a serving platter. Mash the yolks into a fine crumble using a fork. Add mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper, and mix well.</li>
                <li>Evenly disperse heaping teaspoons of the yolk mixture into the egg whites. Sprinkle with paprika and serve.</li>
        </ol>
