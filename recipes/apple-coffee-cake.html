        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Apple work wonders in this easy coffee cake. They add extra sweetness as well as making the cake extra moist and tender. The streusel topping adds a crunchy texture that pairs perfectly with the moist, soft center. It's only made better by serving it with a hot cup of coffee and a good friend.
